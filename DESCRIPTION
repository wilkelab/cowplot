Version: 0.3.1
Authors@R: c( person("Claus O.", "Wilke", role = c("aut", "cre"), email =

Description: Some helpful extensions and modifications to the 'ggplot2' library.
    In particular, this package makes it easy to combine multiple 'ggplot2' plots
    into one and label them with letters, e.g. A, B, C, etc., as is often required
    for scientific publications. The package also provides a streamlined and clean
    theme that is used in the Wilke lab, hence the package name, which stands for
    Claus O. Wilke's plot library.
