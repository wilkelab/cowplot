is on (the default).}

\item{linetype}{Line type.}

\item{remove}{If \code{TRUE}, removes the current panel border.}

This function provides a simple way to modify the panel border in ggplot2. It
doesn't do anything that can't be done just the same with \code{theme()}. However, it
saves some typing.
