\title{Add/remove the panel border in a ggplot2 plot}
\usage{
panel_border(color = "grey85", size = 1, linetype = 1, remove = FALSE, colour)
}
\arguments{
\item{color, colour}{The color of the border.}

\item{size}{Size. Needs to be twice as large as desired outcome when panel clipping
is on (the default).}

\item{linetype}{Line type.}

\item{remove}{If \code{TRUE}, removes the current panel border.}
}
\description{
This function provides a simple way to modify the panel border in ggplot2. It
doesn't do anything that can't be done just the same with \code{\link[ggplot2:theme]{ggplot2::theme()}}. However, it
saves some typing.
