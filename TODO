Ideas for further development
=============================
- add more finegrained formatting options to plot_grid, e.g., per-plot x and y offsets, same for labels, label colors & fonts, etc. 
- make a theme for individual plots and one for grouped plots (and one for faceted plots?), make sure that all default settings work well together.
- write more documentation. in particular, a vignette about arranging plots on a grid, and one about themes, background grids, faceting, etc.
